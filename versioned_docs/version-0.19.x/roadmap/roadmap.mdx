# Roadmap

**Please follow this link to get to the Keptn [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/keptn/projects/1) maintained at GitHub**

## Organization of the Roadmap

In Keptn, the roadmap is organized based on _Keptn Enhancements Proposals_ ([KEP](https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals#keptn-enhancement-proposals)) that are mapped to Keptn releases. A KEP describes a value increment for driving the direction of the Keptn project. A KEP is open for discussion and once accepted it is broken down into implementation issues. These issues are then added to a milestone and delivered by Keptn releases.

## How can I contribute to the Roadmap?

- Feel free to start discussing KEPs that are already planned and put on the roadmap.
- Feel free to file a new KEP to tell us the value increment you would like to have in Keptn: Instructions therefore are provided [here](https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals#writing-a-new-proposal)
