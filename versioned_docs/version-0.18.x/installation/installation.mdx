The steps to install and configure your Keptn instance are:

1. [Create or bring a Kubernetes cluster](k8s)

   - Check [Kubernetes support and cluster size](k8s-support)
     to ensure that your version of Kubernetes is compatible
     with the Keptn version you are installing
     and that you have adequate resources.

2. Decide [how you want to access Keptn](access).
   Kubernetes supports exposing Keptn via a LoadBalancer, a NodePort, an Ingress
   or using a Port-forward.

3. Install [Keptn CLI](cli-install) on the cloud shell machine
   that is used to access your cloud provider, Kubernetes cluster, etc (recommended).

4. Install the [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh).

5. Install Keptn using a [Helm chart](helm-install)

   - All on one cluster
   - Install using a [Multi-cluster setup](multi-cluster),
     meaning that the Keptn Control Plane is installed in one Kubernetes cluster
     and the Keptn Execution Plane is installed in one or more other Kubernetes clusters.

6. [Authenticate CLI and Bridge](authenticate-cli-bridge)

7. Install software to run Keptn tasks

   - [Job Executor Service](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md)
     - The [Job Executor Service](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service)
       runs Keptn customizable tasks as Kubernetes jobs.
       See [Job Executor Service Features](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service/blob/main/docs/FEATURES.md) for more details.
     - Also see [Job Executor Service Architecture](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#example-configuration)
   - [Istio](istio)

8. If you are using [Quality Gates](../concepts/quality_gates),
   install the [monitoring service](monitoring) you want to use.

9. Configure [webhooks](webhook_service) (optional)

10. If you have problems with your installation,
    check out the hints in [Troubleshooting the installation](troubleshooting)
