<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator that helps you ship beautiful, accessible docs. For building our documentation engine, we have made certain modifications to the template generated by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to be able to properly showcase all our contents with their respective versions.

### Built With

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This section describes how you can get our documentation portal up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/new-keptn-docs-engine
```

2. Install NPM packages

```shell
npm install
```

3. Run the app

```shell
npm start
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

<!-- In usage, mention how to edit the docs, how to update versions, etc. -->

### Writing Documentation

To just edit older documentation, go to the specified versioned folder for a section, for example, you want to edit documentation for Release 0.16.x, open up `Release 0.16.x` folder and edit the required files there.

To create a new version inside a section, for example, Go. Make your changes in [docs/Go](./docs/Go). The `./docs` folder consists of the `next` version, which is unpublished, and is where you add your newer or _next_ version of the documentation.

After your changes are done, to create a version, run the following command:

```shell
npm run docusaurus docs:version:Go 1.2.3
```

This will create a new version `1.2.3` for Go.

### To add new sections

Create a new section in docusaurus by adding a new plugin entry in [docusaurus.config.js](./docusaurus.config.js).

Say you're adding a new Go section:

```javascript
{
  plugins: [
    // ...
    [
      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs',
      {
        path: 'docs/go',
        routeBasePath: 'go',
        id: 'go',
        sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars/sidebars-go.js'),
        sidebarCollapsible: false,
        onlyIncludeVersions: !isDev ? require('./go_versions.json') : undefined,
      },
    ],
  ];
}
```

After you add this, you'll need to create a [sidebars file](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar) `./sidebars/sidebars-go.js`.

Also, add your new docs to `./docs/go`, say you add `introduction.mdx`

Now, run `npm start` and you can access your Go docs at [http://localhost:3000/go/introduction](http://localhost:3000/go/introduction)

Then, you can create versions and edit older versions as mentioned above.
