<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator that helps you ship beautiful, accessible docs. For building our documentation engine, we have made certain modifications to the template generated by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to be able to properly showcase all our contents with their respective versions.

### Built With

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

<!-- In usage, mention how to edit the docs, how to update versions, etc. -->

### Writing Documentation

To just edit older documentation, go to the specified versioned folder for a section, for example, you want to edit documentation for Release 0.16.x, open up `Release 0.16.x` folder and edit the required files there.

To create a new version inside a section, for example, Go. Make your changes in [docs/Go](./docs/Go). The `./docs` folder consists of the `next` version, which is unpublished, and is where you add your newer or _next_ version of the documentation.

After your changes are done, to create a version, run the following command:

```shell
npm run docusaurus docs:version:Go 1.2.3
```

This will create a new version `1.2.3` for Go.

Reference: [https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning)

### To add new sections

Create a new section in docusaurus by adding a new plugin entry in [docusaurus.config.js](./docusaurus.config.js).

Say you're adding a new Go section:

```javascript
{
  plugins: [
    // ...
    [
      "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs",
      {
        path: "docs/go",
        routeBasePath: "go",
        id: "go",
        sidebarPath: require.resolve("./sidebars/sidebars-go.js"),
        sidebarCollapsible: false,
        onlyIncludeVersions: !isDev ? require("./go_versions.json") : undefined,
      },
    ],
  ];
}
```

After you add this, you'll need to create a [sidebars file](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar) `./sidebars/sidebars-go.js`.

Also, add your new docs to `./docs/go`, say you add `introduction.mdx`

Now, run `npm start` and you can access your Go docs at [http://localhost:3000/go/introduction](http://localhost:3000/go/introduction)

Then, you can create versions and edit older versions as mentioned above.

## Documentation Guidelines about Tools that are integrated with this documentation site

### Lighthouse CI

Lighthouse CI is a suite of tools that make continuously running, saving, retrieving, and asserting against [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) results as easily as possible.

#### Features

- Get a Lighthouse report alongside every PR.
- Prevent regressions in accessibility, SEO, offline support, and performance best practices.
- Track performance metrics and Lighthouse scores over time.
- Set and keep performance budgets on scripts and images.
- Run Lighthouse many times to reduce variance.
- Compare two versions of your site to find improvements and regressions of individual resources.

The LightHouse CI should ideally:

- Add `lighthousesrc.json` to identify the metrics we are looking to track.
- Use the `jakepartusch/wait-for-netlify-action` action to grab the deployed preview link.
- Use the `treosh/lighthouse-ci-action` to audit the preview link through LightHouse and upload generated files as an artifact.
- Use the `actions/github-script` and `marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment` to mark the performance as a PR comment.
